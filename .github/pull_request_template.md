Following this checklist to help us incorporate your 
contribution quickly and easily:

 - [ ] Make sure there is a [JIRA issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MENFORCER) filed 
       for the change (usually before you start working on it).  Trivial changes like typos do not 
       require a JIRA issue.  Your pull request should address just this issue, without 
       pulling in other changes.
 - [ ] Each commit in the pull request should have a meaningful subject line and body.
 - [ ] Format the pull request title like `[MENFORCER-XXX] - Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `MENFORCER-XXX` with 
       the appropriate JIRA issue.
 - [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.
 - [ ] Run `mvn clean install` to make sure basic checks pass. A more thorough check will be performed on your pull request automatically.

If your pull request has less than ~20 lines of code you don't need to sign an
[Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.pdf)
but you have to make clear to declare the contribution to be licenses under 
the [Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
which you need to acknowledge by using the following check-box.
